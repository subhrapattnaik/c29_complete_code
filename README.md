# c29_complete_code

game, called Feed the Bunny!
Before we get started with the code, let's see a quick overview of the game.
Note: Image to be presented from the Visual Aid.
In this game, we have a watermelon fruit hanging from the rope.
The bunny is waiting at the bottom to eat the watermelon fruit.
When the user clicks on the cut the rope button, the

watermelon falls and the bunny eats it.
As we have seen in the visual aid, we will have different arrangements of ropes in the further classes, in a way so that the user has to choose which rope to cut for the watermelon to land on the bunny.
